Multi-user chatrooms for Django, based on Openfire and converse.js

Searching with some keywords, including *Django*, *Openfire* and *converse.js*, I stumbled upon the Freelancer portal, and published a "project" with the following description:

*I want to associate a permanent chatroom - for now text only chat plus presence detection - to each project in a collaborative learning platform; we know the identity of the project members and must add them programmatically to the Openfire chatroom. The platform is based on Django. We have an Ubuntu virtual server on AWS. We need a working setup as an example that we will customize.*

Soon, 5 freelancers posted a proposal; I started negotiating with the guy that appeared to me most competent; his nickname is Crodjer; he is present also on GitHub with the same nickname (github.com/crodjer). We agreed that, as a first paid step, he would write down a more complete and binding proposal within a fixed budget.

After testing the result of the project, and doing a first integration of it in the CommonS Platform (see the commons repository), I publish it here with minimal modifications.

Please note that I'm using this package as a Django *application* inside a larger project, where some modules - for example settings.py - are not used.
